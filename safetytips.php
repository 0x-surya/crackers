        <p>Always supervise children and have a bucket of water ready for emergencies. Wear
          close-fitting
          clothes to prevent accidental fires. Use a long stick or agarbathi to ignite fireworks
          and
          maintain a safe distance. Never re-light malfunctioning fireworks; soak them in water
          instead.
          Avoid using fireworks near buildings, trees, or overhead obstructions.</p>
